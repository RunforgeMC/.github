## Join our Team

If you think that our project sounds interesting, and you think you can contribute, we are constantly looking for new people to add to the team.
Most of our positions are currently volunteer positions because we just don't have the funds to pay for your work. In the future we may be able to provide some compensation. If you are interested in applying, you can join the [discord](https://discord.gg/csEJbhVRxn). Applications can be found in #applications.
You must be proficient in a useful skill and you must be active. You will need to be able to attend meetings and spend lots of time working on the server. Questions can be answered in the [discord](https://discord.gg/csEJbhVRxn).
